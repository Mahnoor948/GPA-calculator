# GPA-calculator
This is a dynamic and interactive GPA Calculator built using Python Tkinter. The application allows users to enter subject names and corresponding grades on a 0â€“4 scale, and dynamically add or remove subjects as needed. Once all inputs are entered, users can calculate their GPA, which is displayed along with a color-coded letter grade and visual feedback using emojis. The interface is designed to be clean, modern, and user-friendly, featuring styled buttons, responsive input rows, and clear result display. Additional features include a reset button to clear all entries instantly and a scrollable layout for handling multiple subjects without stretching the window. This project demonstrates practical GUI programming in Python, combining dynamic user interaction with a visually appealing design.
